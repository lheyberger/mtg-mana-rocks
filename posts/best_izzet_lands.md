Building a 2 colors Commander deck is always tricky. Compared to the other configurations (1 color and 3+ colors), 2 colors decks have less ways of [fixing][Mana Fixing] their [manabase][Manabase] than other combinations.

That's why it's particularly important to know what your options are if you want to make the most out of your [manabase][Manabase].


# 10. Frostboil Snarl

![Frostboil Snarl](assets/frostboil_snarl.jpg)

More restrictive than Sulfur Falls because it requires you to have an actual [Island][Island] or a [Mountain][Mountain] in your starting hand.


# 9. Sulfur Falls

![Sulfur Falls](assets/sulfur_falls.jpg)

More flexible than Frostboil Snarl because you can keep a hand with a fetch land in addition to Sulfur Falls.


# 8. Riverglide Pathway // Lavaglide Pathway

![Riverglide Pathway // Lavaglide Pathway](assets/riverglide_pathway_lavaglide_pathway.jpg)

Doesn't really fix your mana but at least you get to choose your color.


# 7. Cascade Bluffs

![Cascade Bluffs](assets/cascade_bluffs.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for both of your colors if you happen to already have one of those two colors. Provides you colorless mana in the meantime.


# 6. Shivan Reef

![Shivan Reef](assets/shivan_reef.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for your deck with a 1 life drawback each time. Won't hurt you if you don't need the colored mana.


# 5. Fiery Islet

![Fiery Islet](assets/fiery_islet.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for your deck with a 1 life drawback each time. Can replace itself if you are desperate to draw a card.


# 4. Training Center

![Training Center](assets/training_center.jpg)

No drawback in a Commander game other than not being fetchable.


# 3. Steam Vents

![Steam Vents](assets/steam_vents.jpg)

Almost as good as it's older brother, [Volcanic Island][Volcanic Island].

Prefered target when cracking a [Scalding Tarn][Scalding Tarn] if you have no relevant play to follow with.


# 2. Volcanic Island

![Volcanic Island](assets/volcanic_island.jpg)

The king of dual lands: Perfect, no drawback, no tempo loss.

I only ranked [Scalding Tarn][Scalding Tarn] higher because of the amazing flexibility.


# 1. Scalding Tarn

![Scalding Tarn](assets/scalding_tarn.jpg)

This is the perfect land for your [Izzet][Izzet] Commander deck.

It's an [Island][Island] when you need it.
It's a [Mountain][Mountain] when you need it.
If your budget allows it, it can be a [Volcanic Island][Volcanic Island] at instant speed.
If you have nothing else to play, it can be a [Steam Vents][Steam Vents] that enters the battlefield tapped.

You should always wait until the last minute to crack your fetch land: if you need to play [Dispel][Dispel] at instant speed or a [Pyroblast][Pyroblast] at the end of your opponent's turn, just go fetch a [Volcanic Island][Volcanic Island], otherwise, at the end of your opponent's turn, go fetch a [Steam Vents][Steam Vents] and let it enter the battlefield tapped.

Cracking a fetch land and shuffling your library is also what makes it so good. If for whatever reason, you're not happy with your [scry][Scry], or the cards you put back on top of your library with a [Scroll Rack][Scroll Rack] or [Brainstorm][Brainstorm], you can get rid of them by cracking the [Scalding Tarn][Scalding Tarn].

You can also double your fetch land activations with cards like [Rings of Brighthearth][Rings of Brighthearth].
