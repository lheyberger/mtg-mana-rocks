Building a 2 colors Commander deck is always tricky. Compared to the other configurations (1 color and 3+ colors), 2 colors decks have less ways of [fixing][Mana Fixing] their [manabase][Manabase] than other combinations.

That's why it's particularly important to know what your options are if you want to make the most out of your [manabase][Manabase].


# 10. Woodland Cemetery

![Woodland Cemetery](assets/woodland_cemetery.jpg)

You cannot keep your hand if this is your only land, other than that, you are good to go.


# 9. Tainted Wood

![Tainted Wood](assets/tainted_wood.jpg)

Will shine more in decks relying heavily on Black. Will provide colorless mana in the meantime.


# 8. Darkbore Pathway // Slitherbore Pathway

![Darkbore Pathway // Slitherbore Pathway](assets/darkbore_pathway_slitherbore_pathway.jpg)

Doesn't really fix your mana but at least you get to choose your color.


# 7. Twilight Mire

![Twilight Mire](assets/twilight_mire.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for both of your colors if you happen to already have one of those two colors. Provides you colorless mana in the meantime.


# 6. Llanowar Wastes

![Llanowar Wastes](assets/llanowar_wastes.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for your deck with a 1 life drawback each time. Won't hurt you if you don't need the colored mana.


# 5. Nurturing Peatland

![Nurturing Peatland](assets/nurturing_peatland.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for your deck with a 1 life drawback each time. Can replace itself if you are desperate to draw a card.


# 4. Undergrowth Stadium

![Undergrowth Stadium](assets/undergrowth_stadium.jpg)

No drawback in a Commander game other than not being fetchable.


# 3. Overgrown Tomb

![Overgrown Tomb](assets/overgrown_tomb.jpg)

Almost as good as it's older brother, [Bayou][Bayou].

Prefered target when cracking an [Verdant Catacombs][Verdant Catacombs] if you have no relevant play to follow with.


# 2. Bayou

![Bayou](assets/bayou.jpg)

The king of dual lands: Perfect, no drawback, no tempo loss.

I only ranked [Verdant Catacombs][Verdant Catacombs] higher because of the amazing flexibility.


# 1. Verdant Catacombs

![Verdant Catacombs](assets/verdant_catacombs.jpg)

This is the perfect land for your [Golgari][Golgari] Commander deck.

It's a [Swamp][Swamp] when you need it.
It's an [Forest][Forest] when you need it.
If your budget allows it, it can be a [Bayou][Bayou] at instant speed.
If you have nothing else to play, it can be a [Overgrown Tomb][Overgrown Tomb] that enters the battlefield tapped.

You should always wait until the last minute to crack your fetch land: if you need to play [Vampiric Tutor][Vampiric Tutor] or [Worldly Tutor][Worldly Tutor] at instant speed, just go fetch a [Bayou][Bayou], otherwise, at the end of your opponent's turn, go fetch a [Overgrown Tomb][Overgrown Tomb] and let it enter the battlefield tapped.

Cracking a fetch land and shuffling your library is also what makes it so good. If for whatever reason, you're not happy with your [scry][Scry], or the cards you put back on top of your library with a [Scroll Rack][Scroll Rack] or [Sylvan Library][Sylvan Library], you can get rid of them by cracking the [Verdant Catacombs][Verdant Catacombs].

Fetch lands are also good targets for recursion spells or abilities like [Crucible of Worlds][Crucible of Worlds].

You can also double your fetch land activations with cards like [Rings of Brighthearth][Rings of Brighthearth].
