Building a 2 colors Commander deck is always tricky. Compared to the other configurations (1 color and 3+ colors), 2 colors decks have less ways of [fixing][Mana Fixing] their [manabase][Manabase] than other combinations.

That's why it's particularly important to know what your options are if you want to make the most out of your [manabase][Manabase].


# 10. Dragonskull Summit

Flexible enough that you can probably keep a hand with another land and be good to go.


# 9. Tainted Peak

![Tainted Peak](assets/tainted_peak.jpg)

Will shine more in decks relying heavily on Black. Will provide colorless mana in the meantime.


# 8. Shadowblood Ridge

![Shadowblood Ridge](assets/shadowblood_ridge.jpg)

You cannot keep your hand if this is your only land, other than that, you are good to go.


# 7. Blightstep Pathway // Searstep Pathway

![Blightstep Pathway // Searstep Pathway](assets/blightstep_pathway_searstep_pathway.jpg)

Doesn't really fix your mana but at least you get to choose your color.


# 6. Graven Cairns

![Graven Cairns](assets/graven_cairns.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for both of your colors if you happen to already have one of those two colors. Provides you colorless mana in the meantime.


# 5. Sulfurous Springs

![Sulfurous Springs](assets/sulfurous_springs.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for your deck with a 1 life drawback each time. Won't hurt you if you don't need the colored mana.


# 4. Luxury Suite

![Luxury Suite](assets/luxury_suite.jpg)

No drawback in a Commander game other than not being fetchable.


# 3. Blood Crypt

![Blood Crypt](assets/blood_crypt.jpg)

Almost as good as it's older brother, [Badlands][Badlands].

Prefered target when cracking [Bloodstained Mire][Bloodstained Mire] if you have no relevant play to follow with.


# 2. Badlands

![Badlands](assets/badlands.jpg)

The king of dual lands: Perfect, no drawback, no tempo loss.

I only ranked [Bloodstained Mire][Bloodstained Mire] higher because of the amazing flexibility.


# 1. Bloodstained Mire

![Bloodstained Mire](assets/bloodstained_mire.jpg)

This is the perfect land for your [Rakdos][Rakdos] Commander deck.

It's a [Swamp][Swamp] when you need it.
It's an [Mountain][Mountain] when you need it.
If your budget allows it, it can be a [Badlands][Badlands] at instant speed.
If you have nothing else to play, it can be a [Blood Crypt][Blood Crypt] that enters the battlefield tapped.

You should always wait until the last minute to crack your fetch land: if you need to play [Vampiric Tutor][Vampiric Tutor] or [Pyroblast][Pyroblast] at instant speed, just go fetch a [Badlands][Badlands], otherwise, at the end of your opponent's turn, go fetch a [Blood Crypt][Blood Crypt] and let it enter the battlefield tapped.

Cracking a fetch land and shuffling your library is also what makes it so good. If for whatever reason, you're not happy with your [scry][Scry], or the cards you put back on top of your library with a [Scroll Rack][Scroll Rack], you can get rid of them by cracking the [Bloodstained Mire][Bloodstained Mire].

Fetch lands are also good targets for recursion spells or abilities like [Crucible of Worlds][Crucible of Worlds].

You can also double your fetch land activations with cards like [Rings of Brighthearth][Rings of Brighthearth].
