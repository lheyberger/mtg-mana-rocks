With the exception of [monocolor][Monocolor] commanders, properly building your [manabase][Manabase] can be a real challenge.

The first candidates you should consider when selecting your lands are [fetches][Fetch Lands].

# History

[Fetch lands][Fetch Lands] were first introduced in [Mirage][Mirage] as an [allied color][Allied Color] cycle. Each of them enters the battlefield tapped and can be sacrificed to search for a land card with at least one of two basic land types of an [allied color][Allied Color] pair.

The ones we are really interested in were first introduced in [Onslaught][Onslaught], again in [allied colors][Allied Color] only, but the full cycle was completed in [Zendikar] with the addition of the [enemy colors][Enemy Color].

Each of these lands enter the battlefield untapped. They allow their controller to sacrifice them and pay one life to search their library for a land card with at least one of two basic land types of an [enemy color][Enemy Color] pair.

# Why should I consider them?

[Fetch lands][Fetch Lands] are the perfect lands for your [multicolor][Multicolor] Commander decks:
- It's any [basic land][Basic Land] when you need it.
- If your budget allows it, it can be any [dual land][Dual Land] at instant speed.
- If you don't have a relevant play to follow up, it can be any [shock land][Shock Land] that enters the battlefield tapped.
- They enable some recursion shenanigans with cards like [Brought Back][Brought Back] or [Sun Titan][Sun Titan].
- You can double your activations with cards like [Rings of Brighthearth][Rings of Brighthearth].

Cracking a [fetch lands][Fetch Lands] and [shuffling][Shuffle] your library is also what makes it so good. If for whatever reason, you're not happy with cards you just put back on top of your library with a [Scroll Rack][Scroll Rack] or [Brainstorm][Brainstorm], you can get rid of them by cracking your [fetch lands][Fetch Lands].

In addition of being very good in almost all commander decks, [fetch lands][Fetch Lands] integrates very well in a few archetypes:
- Landfall, with commanders like [Tatyova, Benthic Druid][Tatyova Benthic Druid]
- Land Matters, with commanders like [Omnath, Locus of Rage][Omnath Locus of Rage], [Omnath, Locus of the Roil][Omnath Locus of the Roil] and [Lord Windgrace][Lord Windgrace]
- Recursion, with commanders like [Muldrotha, the Gravetide][Muldrotha the Gravetide]
