Building a 2 colors Commander deck is always tricky. Compared to the other configurations (1 color and 3+ colors), 2 colors decks have less ways of [fixing][Mana Fixing] their [manabase][Manabase] than other combinations.

That's why it's particularly important to know what your options are if you want to make the most out of your [manabase][Manabase].


# 10. Drowned Catacomb

![Drowned Catacomb](assets/drowned_catacomb.jpg)

Flexible enough that you can probably keep a hand with another land and be good to go.


# 9. Tainted Isle

![Tainted Isle](assets/tainted_isle.jpg)

Will shine more in decks relying heavily on Black. Will provide colorless mana in the meantime.


# 8. Darkwater Catacombs

![Darkwater Catacombs](assets/darkwater_catacombs.jpg)

You cannot keep your hand if this is your only land, other than that, you are good to go.


# 7. Clearwater Pathway // Murkwater Pathway

![Clearwater Pathway // Murkwater Pathway](assets/clearwater_pathway_murkwater_pathway.jpg)

Doesn't really fix your mana but at least you get to choose your color.


# 6. Sunken Ruins

![Sunken Ruins](assets/sunken_ruins.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for both of your colors if you happen to already have one of those two colors. Provides you colorless mana in the meantime.


# 5. Underground River

![Underground River](assets/underground_river.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for your deck with a 1 life drawback each time. Won't hurt you if you don't need the colored mana.


# 4. Morphic Pool

![Morphic Pool](assets/morphic_pool.jpg)

No drawback in a Commander game other than not being fetchable.


# 3. Watery Grave

![Watery Grave](assets/watery_grave.jpg)

Almost as good as it's older brother, [Underground Sea][Underground Sea].

Prefered target when cracking an [Polluted Delta][Polluted Delta] if you have no relevant play to follow with.


# 2. Underground Sea

![Underground Sea](assets/underground_sea.jpg)

The king of dual lands: Perfect, no drawback, no tempo loss.

I only ranked [Polluted Delta][Polluted Delta] higher because of the amazing flexibility.


# 1. Polluted Delta

![Polluted Delta](assets/polluted_delta.jpg)

This is the perfect land for your [Dimir][Dimir] Commander deck.

It's a [Swamp][Swamp] when you need it.
It's an [Island][Island] when you need it.
If your budget allows it, it can be a [Underground Sea][Underground Sea] at instant speed.
If you have nothing else to play, it can be a [Watery Grave][Watery Grave] that enters the battlefield tapped.

You should always wait until the last minute to crack your fetch land: if you need to play [Vampiric Tutor][Vampiric Tutor] or [Dispel][Dispel] at instant speed, just go fetch a [Underground Sea][Underground Sea], otherwise, at the end of your opponent's turn, go fetch a [Watery Grave][Watery Grave] and let it enter the battlefield tapped.

Cracking a fetch land and shuffling your library is also what makes it so good. If for whatever reason, you're not happy with your [scry][Scry], or the cards you put back on top of your library with a [Scroll Rack][Scroll Rack] or [Brainstorm][Brainstorm], you can get rid of them by cracking the [Polluted Delta][Polluted Delta].

Fetch lands are also good targets for recursion spells or abilities like [Crucible of Worlds][Crucible of Worlds].

You can also double your fetch land activations with cards like [Rings of Brighthearth][Rings of Brighthearth].
