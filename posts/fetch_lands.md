With the exception of [monocolor][Monocolor] commanders, properly building your [manabase][Manabase] can be a real challenge.

Having access to the right color at the right time is key to being able to cast spells.

[Fetch Lands][Fetch Lands] are a specific type of lands that can be sacrificed to search their controller's library for another land.

In addition to giving you access to the right colors, [Fetch Lands][Fetch Lands] also help you remove lands from your library and thus reducing the likelihood of drawing a land late game, when mana is no longer an issue.

Their ability to [shuffle][Shuffle] on command also adds flexibility.


# Mirage fetch lands

![Mirage Fetch Lands](assets/mirage_fetch_lands.jpg)

[Fetch lands][Fetch Lands] were first introduced in [Mirage][Mirage] as an [allied color][Allied Color] cycle.
Each of these enters the battlefield tapped and can be sacrificed to search for a land with at least one of two basic land types of an [allied color][Allied Color] pair.


# Shards of Alara panoramas

![Shards of Alara Panoramas](assets/alara_panoramas.jpg)

The panorama were released in [Shards of Alara][Shards of Alara] as a [Shard][Shard] cycle.
They all tap for 1 colorless mana.
The panoramas allow you to fetch for 3 basic land types at the expense of paying 1 colorless mana and having the land entering the battlefield tapped.


# New Capenna fetch lands

[Streets of New Capenna][Streets of New Capenna] fetch lands sacrifice themselves when they enter the battlefield to find a basic land in one of the three colors of their respective families.
In addition to fetching, they also gain you 1 life.


# Miscellaneous fetch lands

In addition the previously mentioned fetch lands, there are a lot of variants not part of specific cycles.

![Honorable mentions 1](assets/fetch_lands_honorable_mentions_1.jpg)

[Terramorphic Expanse][Terramorphic Expanse], [Evolving Wilds][Evolving Wilds] and [Fabled Passage][Fabled Passage] all allow you to fetch for a basic land right away but only the later will conditionaly have it enter the battlefield untapped.

![Honorable mentions 2](assets/fetch_lands_honorable_mentions_2.jpg)

[Blighted Woodland][Blighted Woodland], [Krosan Verge][Krosan Verge] and [Myriad Landscape][Myriad Landscape] allow you to fetch for two lands at the expense of either of mana or tempo.

![Honorable mentions 3](assets/fetch_lands_honorable_mentions_3.jpg)

[Terminal Moraine][Terminal Moraine] and [Warped Landscape][Warped Landscape] will both fetch one basic land for one mana, entering the battlefield tapped.
[Thawing Glaciers][Thawing Glaciers] gives away some tempo but allows for a small synergy if you manage to untap it.

![Honorable mentions 4](assets/fetch_lands_honorable_mentions_4.jpg)

[Flagstones of Trokair][Flagstones of Trokair] and [Maze's End][Maze's End] are mostly reserved for very niche setup. [Maze's End][Maze's End] could make its way in more budget manabases with the additional gates printed in [Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate][Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate].

[Prismatic Vista][Prismatic Vista] is probably the closest one in terms of power as it can fetch for a basic land entering the battlefield untapped for the price of 1 life.


# The "real" fetch lands

![Onslaught Fetch Lands](assets/onslaught_fetchlands.jpg)

The "real" fetch lands were first introduced in [Onslaught][Onslaught] in [Allied colors][Allied Color] only.

![Zendikar Fetch Lands](assets/zendikar_fetchlands.jpg)

The cycle was completed in [Zendikar][Zendikar] with the addition of the [Enemy colors][Enemy Color].

They enter the battlefield untapped and for 1 life, will fetch for a land with a basic land type, also entering the battlefield untapped.


# Why should I consider them?

If your budget allows it, [Fetch lands][Fetch Lands] are the perfect lands for your [multicolor][Multicolor] Commander decks.

In a nutshell:

- They help you fix your mana by fetching the right land at the right time.
- They get you an additional [Landfall][Landfall] trigger ([Lotus Cobra][Lotus Cobra], [Avenger of Zendikar][Avenger of Zendikar], [Felidar Retreat][Felidar Retreat])
- They synergize particularly well with recursion spells and abilities ([Life from the Loam][Life from the Loam], [Brought Back][Brought Back], [Sun Titan][Sun Titan]).
- They help you get rid of unwanted cards at the top of your library ([Scroll Rack][Scroll Rack], [Brainstorm][Brainstorm], [Sylvan Library][Sylvan Library]).
- They help you fill your [graveyard][Graveyard] if you are trying to reach [Threshold][Threshold] or [Delirium][Delirium].
- And finally, you can double the effect of their activations ([Rings of Brighthearth][Rings of Brighthearth], [Lithoform Engine][Lithoform Engine]).
