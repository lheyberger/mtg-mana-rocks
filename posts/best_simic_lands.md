Building a 2 colors Commander deck is always tricky. Compared to the other configurations (1 color and 3+ colors), 2 colors decks have less ways of [fixing][Mana Fixing] their [manabase][Manabase] than other combinations.

That's why it's particularly important to know what your options are if you want to make the most out of your [manabase][Manabase].


# 10. Vineglimmer Snarl

More restrictive than Hinterland Harbor because it requires you to have an actual [Forest][Forest] or an [Island][Island] in your starting hand.


# 9. Hinterland Harbor

You cannot keep your hand if this is your only land, other than that, you are good to go.


# 8. Barkchannel Pathway // Tidechannel Pathway

![Barkchannel Pathway // Tidechannel Pathway](assets/barkchannel_pathway_tidechannel_pathway.jpg)

Doesn't really fix your mana but at least you get to choose your color.


# 7. Flooded Grove

![Flooded Grove](assets/flooded_grove.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for both of your colors if you happen to already have one of those two colors. Provides you colorless mana in the meantime.


# 6. Yavimaya Coast

![Yavimaya Coast](assets/yavimaya_coast.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for your deck with a 1 life drawback each time. Won't hurt you if you don't need the colored mana.


# 5. Waterlogged Grove

![Waterlogged Grove](assets/waterlogged_grove.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for your deck with a 1 life drawback each time. Can replace itself if you are desperate to draw a card.


# 4. Rejuvenating Springs

![Rejuvenating Springs](assets/rejuvenating_springs.jpg)

No drawback in a Commander game other than not being fetchable.


# 3. Breeding Pool

![Breeding Pool](assets/breeding_pool.jpg)

Almost as good as it's older brother, [Tropical Island][Tropical Island].

Prefered target when cracking an [Misty Rainforest][Misty Rainforest] if you have no relevant play to follow with.


# 2. Tropical Island

![Tropical Island](assets/tropical_island.jpg)

The king of dual lands: Perfect, no drawback, no tempo loss.

I only ranked [Misty Rainforest][Misty Rainforest] higher because of the amazing flexibility.


# 1. Misty Rainforest

![Misty Rainforest](assets/misty_rainforest.jpg)

This is the perfect land for your [Simic][Simic] Commander deck.

It's a [Forest][Forest] when you need it.
It's an [Island][Island] when you need it.
If your budget allows it, it can be a [Tropical Island][Tropical Island] at instant speed.
If you have nothing else to play, it can be a [Breeding Pool][Breeding Pool] that enters the battlefield tapped.

You should always wait until the last minute to crack your fetch land: if you need to play [Worldly Tutor][Worldly Tutor] or [Dispel][Dispel] at instant speed, just go fetch a [Tropical Island][Tropical Island], otherwise, at the end of your opponent's turn, go fetch a [Breeding Pool][Breeding Pool] and let it enter the battlefield tapped.

Cracking a fetch land and shuffling your library is also what makes it so good. If for whatever reason, you're not happy with your [scry][Scry], or the cards you put back on top of your library with a [Scroll Rack][Scroll Rack] or [Brainstorm][Brainstorm], you can get rid of them by cracking the [Misty Rainforest][Misty Rainforest].

Fetch lands are also good targets for recursion spells or abilities like [Crucible of Worlds][Crucible of Worlds].

You can also double your fetch land activations with cards like [Rings of Brighthearth][Rings of Brighthearth].
