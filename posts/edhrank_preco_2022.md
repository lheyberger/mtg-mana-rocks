# A few observations

It's interesting to look at the results for 2022 preconstructed decks. Here are a few comments for each of the categories:

- **Power** — Evaulations are showing a lack of power for both the face commander and the decklist. This metric would benefit from a revamp in the way it's computed by [@edhrank](https://twitter.com/edhrank).
- **Speed** — Not the worst for preconstructed decks as only a few are lacking on this aspect. In general, there seem to be a decent amount of mana-producers and ramp or draw spells in the decklists.
- **Control** — This year's decklists are generally lacking interactions (counter spells, target removal or mass removal) which makes sense if they are supposed to be an introduction to the format.
- **Consistency** — This metric blends the combo potential as well as the number of tutors or draw spells to assemble them. The general low score for 2022 decklists clearly shows a lack on this aspect. This is not really a surprise as preconstructed decks are naturally leaning towards longer games.

Do you think there are any dimensions that would be worth exploring? Feel free to share any feedbacks.
