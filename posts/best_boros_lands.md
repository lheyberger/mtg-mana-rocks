Building a 2 colors Commander deck is always tricky. Compared to the other configurations (1 color and 3+ colors), 2 colors decks have less ways of [fixing][Mana Fixing] their [manabase][Manabase] than other combinations.

That's why it's particularly important to know what your options are if you want to make the most out of your [manabase][Manabase].


# 10. Furycalm Snarl

![Furycalm Snarl](assets/furycalm_snarl.jpg)

More restrictive than Clifftop Retreat because it requires you to have an actual [Mountain][Mountain] or a [Plains][Plains] in your starting hand.


# 9. Clifftop Retreat

![Clifftop Retreat](assets/clifftop_retreat.jpg)

More flexible than Furycalm Snarl because you can keep a hand with a fetch land in addition to Clifftop Retreat.


# 8. Needleverge Pathway // Pillarverge Pathway

![Needleverge Pathway // Pillarverge Pathway](assets/needleverge_pathway_pillarverge_pathway.jpg)

Doesn't really fix your mana but at least you get to choose your color.


# 7. Rugged Prairie

![Rugged Prairie](assets/rugged_prairie.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for both of your colors if you happen to already have one of those two colors. Provides you colorless mana in the meantime.


# 6. Battlefield Forge

![Battlefield Forge](assets/battlefield_forge.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for your deck with a 1 life drawback each time. Won't hurt you if you don't need the colored mana.


# 5. Sunbaked Canyon

![Sunbaked Canyon](assets/sunbaked_canyon.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for your deck with a 1 life drawback each time. Can replace itself if you are desperate to draw a card.


# 4. Spectator Seating

![Spectator Seating](assets/spectator_seating.jpg)

No drawback in a Commander game other than not being fetchable.


# 3. Sacred Foundry

![Sacred Foundry](assets/sacred_foundry.jpg)

Almost as good as it's older brother, [Plateau][Plateau].

Prefered target when cracking an [Arid Mesa][Arid Mesa] if you have no relevant play to follow with.


# 2. Plateau

![Plateau](assets/plateau.jpg)

The king of dual lands: Perfect, no drawback, no tempo loss.

I only ranked [Arid Mesa][Arid Mesa] higher because of the amazing flexibility.


# 1. Arid Mesa

![Arid Mesa](assets/arid_mesa.jpg)

This is the perfect land for your [Boros][Boros] Commander deck.

It's a [Mountain][Mountain] when you need it.
It's a [Plains][Plains] when you need it.
If your budget allows it, it can be a [Plateau][Plateau] at instant speed.
If you have nothing else to play, it can be a [Sacred Foundry][Sacred Foundry] that enters the battlefield tapped.

You should always wait until the last minute to crack your fetch land: if you need to play [Swords to Plowshares][Swords to Plowshares] at instant speed or a [Pyroblast][Pyroblast] at the end of your opponent's turn, just go fetch a [Plateau][Plateau], otherwise, at the end of your opponent's turn, go fetch a [Sacred Foundry][Sacred Foundry] and let it enter the battlefield tapped.

Cracking a fetch land and shuffling your library is also what makes it so good. If for whatever reason, you're not happy with your [scry][Scry], or the cards you put back on top of your library with a [Scroll Rack][Scroll Rack], you can get rid of them by cracking the [Arid Mesa][Arid Mesa].

Fetch lands are also good targets for recursion spells or abilities like [Brought Back][Brought Back], [Sevinne's Reclamation][Sevinne's Reclamation] or [Sun Titan][Sun Titan].

You can also double your fetch land activations with cards like [Rings of Brighthearth][Rings of Brighthearth].
