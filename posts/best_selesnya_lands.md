Building a 2 colors Commander deck is always tricky. Compared to the other configurations (1 color and 3+ colors), 2 colors decks have less ways of [fixing][Mana Fixing] their [manabase][Manabase] than other combinations.

That's why it's particularly important to know what your options are if you want to make the most out of your [manabase][Manabase].


# 10. Sunpetal Grove

![Sunpetal Grove](assets/sunpetal_grove.jpg)

Flexible enough that you can probably keep a hand with another land and be good to go.


# 9. Sungrass Prairie

![Sungrass Prairie](assets/sungrass_prairie.jpg)

You cannot keep your hand if this is your only land, other than that, you are good to go.


# 8. Branchloft Pathway // Boulderloft Pathway

![Branchloft Pathway // Boulderloft Pathway](assets/branchloft_pathway_boulderloft_pathway.jpg)

Doesn't really fix your mana but at least you get to choose your color.


# 7. Wooded Bastion

![Wooded Bastion](assets/wooded_bastion.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for both of your colors if you happen to already have one of those two colors. Provides you colorless mana in the meantime.


# 6. Brushland

![Brushland](assets/brushland.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for your deck with a 1 life drawback each time. Won't hurt you if you don't need the colored mana.


# 5. Horizon Canopy

![Horizon Canopy](assets/horizon_canopy.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for your deck with a 1 life drawback each time. Can replace itself if you are desperate to draw a card.


# 4. Bountiful Promenade

![Bountiful Promenade](assets/bountiful_promenade.jpg)

No drawback in a Commander game other than not being fetchable.


# 3. Temple Garden

![Temple Garden](assets/temple_garden.jpg)

Almost as good as it's older brother, [Savannah][Savannah].

Prefered target when cracking an [Windswept Heath][Windswept Heath] if you have no relevant play to follow with.


# 2. Savannah

![Savannah](assets/savannah.jpg)

The king of dual lands: Perfect, no drawback, no tempo loss.

I only ranked [Windswept Heath][Windswept Heath] higher because of the amazing flexibility.


# 1. Windswept Heath

![Windswept Heath](assets/windswept_heath.jpg)

This is the perfect land for your [Selesnya][Selesnya] Commander deck.

It's an [Forest][Forest] when you need it.
It's a [Plains][Plains] when you need it.
If your budget allows it, it can be a [Savannah][Savannah] at instant speed.
If you have nothing else to play, it can be a [Temple Garden][Temple Garden] that enters the battlefield tapped.


You should always wait until the last minute to crack your fetch land: if you need to play [Swords to Plowshares][Swords to Plowshares] or [Worldly Tutor][Worldly Tutor] at instant speed, just go fetch a [Savannah][Savannah], otherwise, at the end of your opponent's turn, go fetch a [Temple Garden][Temple Garden] and let it enter the battlefield tapped.

Cracking a fetch land and shuffling your library is also what makes it so good. If for whatever reason, you're not happy with your [scry][Scry], or the cards you put back on top of your library with a [Scroll Rack][Scroll Rack] or [Sylvan Library][Sylvan Library], you can get rid of them by cracking the [Windswept Heath][Windswept Heath].

Fetch lands are also good targets for recursion spells or abilities like [Brought Back][Brought Back], [Sevinne's Reclamation][Sevinne's Reclamation] or [Sun Titan][Sun Titan].

You can also double your fetch land activations with cards like [Rings of Brighthearth][Rings of Brighthearth].
