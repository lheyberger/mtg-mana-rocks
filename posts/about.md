Hello everybody! Let me introduce myself.

My name is Ludovic Heyberger, and I've been playing [Magic The Gathering][Magic The Gathering] since 1995.

I discovered the game with the [4th Edition][4th Edition] and [Ice Age][Ice Age] and I've been playing until [Tempest][Tempest].
I started playing again 5 years later with [Onslaught][Onslaught], [Legion][Legion] and [Sourge][Sourge], and I never stopped since then.

I discovered [Commander][Commander] in 2015, became immediately addicted and never looked back at other formats.

I'm a nerd at heart and I spend most of my free time building [Commander decks][Commander decks], or MTG related [tools][tools].

This website is my humble attempt at contributing to this wonderful format.
