Hello everybody! Let me introduce myself.

My name is Ludovic Heyberger, and I've been playing [Magic The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com) since 1995.

I discovered the game with the [4th Edition](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive/fourth-edition), [HomeLands](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive/homelands) and [Ice Age](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive/ice-age) and I've been playing until [Tempest](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive/tempest).

I started playing again 5 years later with [Onslaught](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive/onslaught), [Legion](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive/legions) and [Sourge](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive/scourge), and I never stopped since then.

I discovered [Commander](http://www.mtgcommander.net) a few years ago and I got immediately totally addicted.

This website is my humble attempt at contributing to this wonderful format.
