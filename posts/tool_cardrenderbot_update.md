⚠️ After being up and running for about 2 years, it's time to retire my card rendering chatbot on [Messenger][Messenger] ⚠️

But don't worry though, the tool is still available on [Telegram][Telegram].


# Why?

Even if it was more popular on [Messenger][Messenger], part of Meta's annual [Data Use Checkup][Data Use Checkup] requires going through a [Business Verification][Business Verification] process. The only issue, is that I'm operating this chatbot on my free time, independently, without any business affiliation.

I tried (to some extent) to provide appropriate documents to pass this process, but the perspective of having to deal with this overhead every year, is honestly not worth the headache.


# What happens next?

ℹ️  The chatbot is still **publicly available and free to use** on [Telegram][Telegram].


## How to use it?

1. Open Telegram
2. Start a new discussion by navigating to [https://t.me/cardrenderbot](https://t.me/cardrenderbot)
3. Press the `Start` button
