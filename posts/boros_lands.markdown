Building a 2 colors Commander deck is always tricky. Compared to the other configurations (1 color and 3+ colors), 2 colors deck manabases have the less solutions.

Counting only dual lands, fetch lands and shock lands 2 colors deck only have 3 of them while 3 colors deck can include 9 of those lands.

# 8. Inspiring Vantage

# 5. Battlefield Forge

Instant speed fixing for your Boros Commander with a 1 life drawback each time. It won't hurt you if you don't need the colored mana.

# 4. Sunbaked Canyon

Instant speed fixing for your Boros Commander with a 1 life drawback each time. You can replace itself during longer games.

# 3. Sacred Foundry

Almost as good as it's older brother, [Plateau](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!plateau).

Prefered target when cracking an [Arid Mesa](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!arid-mesa) if you have no relevant play to follow.

That's also why you should always wait until the last time to crack your fetch land: if you need to play something at instant speed like a [Swords to Plowshares](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!swords-to-plowshares), just go fetch a [Plateau](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!plateau), otherwise, at the end of your opponent's turn, go fetch a [Sacred Foundry](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!sacred-foundry) and let it enter the battlefield tapped.

# 2. Plateau

The king of dual lands: Perfect, no drawback, no tempo loss.

I only ranked [Arid Mesa](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!arid-mesa) higher because of the low life point drawback to crack it and the added flexibility to shuffle the library of be recurred if needed.

# 1. Arid Mesa

This is the perfect land for your Boros Commander deck.

It's a [Mountain](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!mountain) when you need it.
It's a [Plains](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!plains) when you need it.
If your budget allows it, it can be a [Plateau](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!plateau) at instant speed.
If you don't have a relevant play to follow up, it can be a [Sacred Foundry](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!sacred-foundry) that enters the battlefield tapped.

Cracking a fetch land and shuffling your library is also what makes it so good. If for whatever reason, you're not happy with your [scry](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Scry), or cards you put back on top of your library with a [Scroll Rack](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!scroll-rack), you can get rid of them by cracking the [Arid Mesa](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!arid-mesa).

Fetch lands also enable some recursion shenanigans with cards like [Brought Back](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!brought-back) or [Sun Titan](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!sun-titan).

You can also double your fetch land activations with cards like [Rings of Brighthearth](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!rings-of-brighthearth).
