Building a 2 colors Commander deck is always tricky. Compared to the other configurations (1 color and 3+ colors), 2 colors decks have less ways of [fixing][Mana Fixing] their [manabase][Manabase] than other combinations.

On top of that, [Boros][Boros] is not exactly known to be good at [mana fixing][Mana Fixing] and [drawing][Drawing].

So it's particularly important to know what your options are if you want to make the most out of your [manabase][Manabase].

# 8. Inspiring Vantage

Check-land that will provide you the right mana the turn it enters the battlefield provided that you play it in your first three turns. After that, it's a bit slower. Pretty nice in low [CMC][CMC] Commander decks or otherwise in high [CMC][CMC] Commander deck. I wouldn't play it if most of my spells or big turns are around 4 [CMC][CMC].

# 7. Clifftop Retreat

![Clifftop Retreat](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/e/0/e0b52b9c-7278-46b4-9f3c-3a7fc0c7e526.jpg)

Check-land that will provide you the right mana from your second turn until the end of the game.

# 6. Rugged Prairie

![Rugged Prairie](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/4/4/4441514d-d8e0-480f-ab82-b0064dfa7ac0.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for both of your colors if you happen to already have one of those two colors. Can provide you colorless mana in the meantime.

# 5. Battlefield Forge

![Battlefield Forge](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/0/3/034c5944-aad3-4bf2-b79d-8da61ab1bd52.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for your [Boros][Boros] Commander with a 1 life drawback each time. It won't hurt you if you don't need the colored mana.

# 4. Sunbaked Canyon

![Sunbaked Canyon](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/c/3/c36820fa-ee86-4206-9a0d-737a67cf5208.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for your [Boros][Boros] Commander with a 1 life drawback each time. You can replace itself during longer games.

# 3. Sacred Foundry

![Sacred Foundry](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/3/3/33c519df-c6b1-4e32-92bc-8a67ae5cbaab.jpg)

Almost as good as it's older brother, [Plateau][Plateau].

Prefered target when cracking an [Arid Mesa][Arid Mesa] if you have no relevant play to follow.

That's also why you should always wait until the last time to crack your fetch land: if you need to play something at instant speed like a [Swords to Plowshares][Swords to Plowshares], just go fetch a [Plateau][Plateau], otherwise, at the end of your opponent's turn, go fetch a [Sacred Foundry][Sacred Foundry] and let it enter the battlefield tapped.

# 2. Plateau

![Plateau](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/c/6/c6ae9cff-8646-4069-8761-df734e067beb.jpg)

The king of dual lands: Perfect, no drawback, no tempo loss.

I only ranked [Arid Mesa][Arid Mesa] higher because of the low life point drawback to crack it and the added flexibility to shuffle the library of be recurred if needed.

# 1. Arid Mesa

![Arid Mesa](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/front/2/1/21a739c8-d7ca-4204-9398-c47fd1d68447.jpg)

This is the perfect land for your [Boros][Boros] Commander deck.

It's a [Mountain][Mountain] when you need it.
It's a [Plains][Plains] when you need it.
If your budget allows it, it can be a [Plateau][Plateau] at instant speed.
If you don't have a relevant play to follow up, it can be a [Sacred Foundry][Sacred Foundry] that enters the battlefield tapped.

Cracking a fetch land and shuffling your library is also what makes it so good. If for whatever reason, you're not happy with your [scry][Scry], or cards you put back on top of your library with a [Scroll Rack][Scroll Rack], you can get rid of them by cracking the [Arid Mesa][Arid Mesa].

Fetch lands also enable some recursion shenanigans with cards like [Brought Back][Brought Back] or [Sun Titan][Sun Titan].

You can also double your fetch land activations with cards like [Rings of Brighthearth][Rings of Brighthearth].
