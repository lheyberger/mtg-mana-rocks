I've always found ugly how Twitter displayed Magic the Gathering‚Ñ¢ card pictures.

This is why I went on an [expedition][expedition] to fix that and created a dedicated card rendering chatbot available through [Messenger][Messenger] and [Telegram][Telegram].

# Simple examples


## 1. Single card

You can render a single card by typing it's full name:

**üí° Example :**

```

**Result :**
![Arcane Signet](assets/arcane_signet.jpg)

You can also type only part of the full name if there's no ambiguity:

```
wrath god
```

**Result :**
![Wrath of God](assets/wrath_of_god.jpg)


## 2. Single card from a specific set

If you want to render a card from a specific set, you can prefix the name with the set code.

The following example will render [Mana Crypt][Mana Crypt] from the [Kaladesh Inventions][Kaladesh Inventions] set:

**üí° Example :**
```
mps mana crypt
```

**Result :**

## 3. Specific card from a specific set

Some sets contain cards with different illustrations.
If you want a specific card, you can specify the set code and the collector number.

The following example will render the [basic Plains][basic Plains] from the [Dominaria United][Dominaria United] set:

**üí° Example :**
```
dmu plains
```

**Result :**
![Basic Plains](assets/dmu_262.jpg)


The following example will render the [full art Plains][full art Plains] from the [Dominaria United][Dominaria United] set:

**üí° Example :**
```
dmu 277
```

**Result :**

# Advanced examples


## 1. Two cards, side by side

If you want to render two cards, side by side, just type two queries on two lines:

**üí° Example :**
```
Thrasios, Triton Hero
Tymna the Weaver
```

**Result :**
![Thrasios / Tymna](assets/thrasios_tymna.jpg)


## 2. Two-cards combo

If you want to render a two-cards combo, you can seperate the two queries by the `+` sign:

**üí° Example :**
```
Demonic Consultation + Thassa Oracle
```

**Result :**
![Demonic Consultation + Thassa's Oracle](assets/demonic_consultation_thassa_oracle.jpg)


## 3. Two-cards battles

If you want to render a battle between two cards, you can seperate the two queries by the `vs` sign:

**üí° Example :**
```
Esper Sentinel vs Rhystic Study
```

**Result :**
![Esper Sentinel vs Rhystic Study](assets/esper_sentinel_rhystic_study.jpg)


## 4. Three, four and five cards hands

If you want to render up to five cards, just type the queries on seperate lines:

**üí° Example :**
```

bro 280
bro 282
