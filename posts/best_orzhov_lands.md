Building a 2 colors Commander deck is always tricky. Compared to the other configurations (1 color and 3+ colors), 2 colors decks have less ways of [fixing][Mana Fixing] their [manabase][Manabase] than other combinations.

That's why it's particularly important to know what your options are if you want to make the most out of your [manabase][Manabase].


# 10. Isolated Chapel

![Isolated Chapel](assets/isolated_chapel.jpg)

Will fix your mana if you keep a hand with either a [Plains][Plains], a [Swamp][Swamp] or a fetch land to get one or the other.


# 9. Tainted Field

![Tainted Field](assets/tainted_field.jpg)

Will shine more in decks relying heavily on Black. Will provide colorless mana in the meantime. 


# 8. Brightclimb Pathway // Grimclimb Pathway

![Brightclimb Pathway // Grimclimb Pathway](assets/brightclimb_pathway_grimclimb_pathway.jpg)

Doesn't really fix your mana but at least you get to choose your color.


# 7. Fetid Heath

![Fetid Heath](assets/fetid_heath.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for both of your colors if you happen to already have one of those two colors. Provides you colorless mana in the meantime.


# 6. Caves of Koilos

![Caves of Koilos](assets/caves_of_koilos.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for your deck with a 1 life drawback each time. Won't hurt you if you don't need the colored mana.


# 5. Silent Clearing

![Silent Clearing](assets/silent_clearing.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for your deck with a 1 life drawback each time. Can replace itself if you are desperate to draw a card.


# 4. Vault of Champions

![Vault of Champions](assets/vault_of_champions.jpg)

No drawback in a Commander game other than not being fetchable.


# 3. Godless Shrine

![Godless Shrine](assets/godless_shrine.jpg)

Almost as good as it's older brother, [Scrubland][Scrubland].

Prefered target when cracking a [Marsh Flats][Marsh Flats] if you have no relevant play to follow with.


# 2. Scrubland

![Scrubland](assets/scrubland.jpg)

The king of dual lands: Perfect, no drawback, no tempo loss.

I only ranked [Marsh Flats][Marsh Flats] higher because of the amazing flexibility.


# 1. Marsh Flats

![Marsh Flats](assets/marsh_flats.jpg)

This is the perfect land for your [Orzhov][Orzhov] Commander deck.

It's a [Plains][Plains] when you need it.
It's a [Swamp][Swamp] when you need it.
If your budget allows it, it can be a [Scrubland][Scrubland] at instant speed.
If you have nothing else to play, it can be a [Godless Shrine][Godless Shrine] that enters the battlefield tapped.

You should always wait until the last minute to crack your fetch land: if you need to play [Swords to Plowshares][Swords to Plowshares] at instant speed or a [Vampiric Tutor][Vampiric Tutor] at the end of your opponent's turn, just go fetch a [Scrubland][Scrubland], otherwise, at the end of your opponent's turn, go fetch a [Godless Shrine][Godless Shrine] and let it enter the battlefield tapped.

Cracking a fetch land and shuffling your library is also what makes it so good. If for whatever reason, you're not happy with your [scry][Scry], or the cards you put back on top of your library with a [Scroll Rack][Scroll Rack], you can get rid of them by cracking the [Marsh Flats][Marsh Flats].

Fetch lands are also good targets for recursion spells or abilities like [Brought Back][Brought Back], [Sevinne's Reclamation][Sevinne's Reclamation] or [Sun Titan][Sun Titan].

You can also double your fetch land activations with cards like [Rings of Brighthearth][Rings of Brighthearth].
