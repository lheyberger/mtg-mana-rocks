Building a 2 colors Commander deck is always tricky. Compared to the other configurations (1 color and 3+ colors), 2 colors decks have less ways of [fixing][Mana Fixing] their [manabase][Manabase] than other combinations.

That's why it's particularly important to know what your options are if you want to make the most out of your [manabase][Manabase].


# 10. Port Town

![Port Town](assets/port_town.jpg)

More restrictive than Glacial Fortress because it requires you to have an actual [Plains][Plains] or an [Island][Island] in your starting hand.


# 9. Glacial Fortress

![Glacial Fortress](assets/glacial_fortress.jpg)

More flexible than Port Town because you can keep a hand with a fetch land in addition to Glacial Fortress.


# 8. Skycloud Expanse

![Skycloud Expanse](assets/skycloud_expanse.jpg)

You cannot keep your hand if this is your only land, other than that, you are good to go.


# 7. Hengegate Pathway // Mistgate Pathway

![Hengegate Pathway // Mistgate Pathway](assets/hengegate_pathway_mistgate_pathway.jpg)

Doesn't really fix your mana but at least you get to choose your color.


# 6. Mystic Gate

![Mystic Gate](assets/mystic_gate.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for both of your colors if you happen to already have one of those two colors. Provides you colorless mana in the meantime.


# 5. Adarkar Wastes

![Adarkar Wastes](assets/adarkar_wastes.jpg)

Instant speed fixing for your deck with a 1 life drawback each time. Won't hurt you if you don't need the colored mana.


# 4. Sea of Clouds

![Sea of Clouds](assets/sea_of_clouds.jpg)

No drawback in a Commander game other than not being fetchable.


# 3. Hallowed Fountain

![Hallowed Fountain](assets/hallowed_fountain.jpg)

Almost as good as it's older brother, [Tundra][Tundra].

Prefered target when cracking an [Flooded Strand][Flooded Strand] if you have no relevant play to follow with.


# 2. Tundra

![Tundra](assets/tundra.jpg)

The king of dual lands: Perfect, no drawback, no tempo loss.

I only ranked [Flooded Strand][Flooded Strand] higher because of the amazing flexibility.


# 1. Flooded Strand

![Flooded Strand](assets/flooded_strand.jpg)

This is the perfect land for your [Azorius][Azorius] Commander deck.

It's a [Plains][Plains] when you need it.
It's an [Island][Island] when you need it.
If your budget allows it, it can be a [Tundra][Tundra] at instant speed.
If you have nothing else to play, it can be a [Hallowed Fountain][Hallowed Fountain] that enters the battlefield tapped.

You should always wait until the last minute to crack your fetch land: if you need to play [Swords to Plowshares][Swords to Plowshares] or [Dispel][Dispel] at instant speed, just go fetch a [Tundra][Tundra], otherwise, at the end of your opponent's turn, go fetch a [Hallowed Fountain][Hallowed Fountain] and let it enter the battlefield tapped.

Cracking a fetch land and shuffling your library is also what makes it so good. If for whatever reason, you're not happy with your [scry][Scry], or the cards you put back on top of your library with a [Scroll Rack][Scroll Rack] or [Brainstorm][Brainstorm], you can get rid of them by cracking the [Flooded Strand][Flooded Strand].

Fetch lands are also good targets for recursion spells or abilities like [Brought Back][Brought Back], [Sevinne's Reclamation][Sevinne's Reclamation] or [Sun Titan][Sun Titan].

You can also double your fetch land activations with cards like [Rings of Brighthearth][Rings of Brighthearth].
